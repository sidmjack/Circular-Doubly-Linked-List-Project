Notes:


We won't maintain a tail reference EVER!
Instead, the tail can ALWAYS be accessed under all cases by:
	this.head.prev

 Problems (so far) with Main:
 Relies on private data to function...
 May need to create getter methods in the classes that contain the values
 main needs.
 Made a print function...Currently resets cursors everytime print is used.
 May need to keep track of current position of elements of each list 
 tampered with and set them back to their original positions after print 
 function is used. Hopefully there's an easier way.
 Other than that, it's hard to tell what else is wrong since it's not
 up and running yet.
