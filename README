Notes:

We won't maintain a tail reference EVER!
Instead, the tail can ALWAYS be accessed under all cases by:

Main Issue:

Though the simulation, as far as we can tell, runs seemlessly and produces reasonable output
based on the thresholds assigned to each simulation run, we've struggled to have our output
match the given "expected" output (which can be found on the assignment Project 1 page). 
The output is within 10 penalty points of the expected, and has the exact number of penalty points
accrued for another simulation (our simulation 3 which had almost the same output). 
At first we supsected that it was the order that the stations and items were run through 
(which was an issue that we fixed and no longer should be throwing off the end value), but 
the values still ended up a bit off. We next suspected that our CTK simulation was off because
of difference in exclsuive/inclusive thresholds. After adjusting these, we still little 
change in the end output. Finally, we thought it might have been the order that we should
tend the items relative to when the tick function ran (Still did nothing!). After comparing the
sample output online with ours we decided that it was likely some combination of issues where
the order of tick, tend, and print were different AND differences in how we handle the 
threshold (inclusive VS exclusive recongition of the threshold).

Other than that, everything else looks good as far as the program running through some
version of Cut Throat Kitchen; the output is different but... *** shrug *** 
hey, we tried.
