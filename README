Notes:


We won't maintain a tail reference EVER!
Instead, the tail can ALWAYS be accessed under all cases by:
	this.head.prev


	append() method is the only way to add a thing to the end of the list.

	add() doesn't work the way we thought. The cursor ends up on the left of the added element, not the right.
